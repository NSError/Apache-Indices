# Apache Indices

Change-up of Apache Indices to use Twitter Bootstrap theme. It looks

# Install

Pay extra-special attention to the `.htaccess` files - they're pretty important. Dump the junk on your webserver, then mangle the configurations in `header.php` to suit your fancy. It'll probably require a bit of tweaking, but it shouldn't be too hard.

You'll need to go fetch your own JQuery and Twitter Bootstrap; dump it somewhere and point to that by editing the header info further down the `header.php` file - it should be fairly self-explanatory. After that, enjoy!
